# CSP2PC
CSP to Procreate brush converter that extracts stamps from .sut files and builds .brush/.brushset files. Automatically maps brush settings for stroke path, taper, shape rendering, wet mix and other properties. Works as CLI or standalone executable. Some CSP-specific features cannot be mapped to Procreate.
